description: I have a very intresting taste in music since they are pretty much all genres, but they are a few that I listen more than the others. Since I grew up in a Latino enviorment, songs from the Latino community have a special place in my heart from the tradtional songs from Vicente Frenández to more modern music like Marc Anthony. If your intrested in listening to some of the songs that I listen too I think this song will be a great start https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuXIgfU8GDc the song name is la pareja del año it is recent but it is a banger.
