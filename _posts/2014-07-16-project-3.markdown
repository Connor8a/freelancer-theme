description: Back in the day when I was still in middle school and highschool a main intrest that I had was sports mainly Cross country and track. Though after awhile I felt like it was something that I didn't truely want in life because I didn't see myself having a future with sports even with my talents. So I made the bold decision to cut off my sports career as a way to get more computer science and engineering classes because those were the things I truely loved.
