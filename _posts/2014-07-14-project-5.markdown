description: I am hyspanic or how my dad calls me a "white-mexican" which I think is very funny because I belong in two cultures, but those cultures don't truely accept me. I am from Llorado Teaxs which is a town that has a very strong Latino population and I was inducted into that culture. Then when my parents moved to Fort Worth, white people didn't know what to do with me so I tried re-entering into the Latino community there, but they didn't fully accept me there as well. Though I have friends in both communities that I am very gratefull for, I did have an identity crises because of my hertiage that I came to accept.
