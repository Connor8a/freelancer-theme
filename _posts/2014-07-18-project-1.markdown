description: What I really enjoy doing just by myself is useally play games sometimes like a solo player game like Cyberpunk2077 (the game has gotten way better since release) or like a MMO game like Wizard 101 if anybody remebers that. I am into card games as a hobbie from electroinc card games like Hearthstone or Magic The Gathering from my personal experience my favorite is MTG, but I play Hearthstone more often.
